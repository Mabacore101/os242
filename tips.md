# TIPS

## Tip#1: Use sudo to do root commands without logging into root. Example: sudo poweroff

### Steps to setup sudo:

### 1. Log in as root using `su -` command.

### 2. Type in this command `sudo usermod -aG sudo username` (change username with your own username).

### 3. Reboot the system/virtual machine.

### 4. Check if sudo is added using `groups username` command.

### 5. Everytime sudo is used, you need to type your own username password.

### One benefit of sudo is it reduces the number of root access to increase security.

## Tip#2: Pay attention to every step in each assignment. Don't miss out the subtle details because the little things give you away.

## Tip#3: Make sure you have enough storage on your device especially for the final 3 weeks.

## Tip#4: It's highly advised to do the final 3 weeks days before the deadline due to the amount of time it takes to complete them.
